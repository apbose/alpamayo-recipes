## What is Alpamayo?

**NVIDIA Alpamayo** is an open platform designed to accelerate the development of safe, transparent, and reasoning-based autonomous vehicles. It consists of vision-language-action (VLA) models, simulation frameworks, reinforcement learning infrastructure, and physical AI datasets and tools. The VLA models scale from the 10B-parameter Alpamayo 1 Nano and Alpamayo 1.5 Nano to the 34B-parameter Alpamayo 2 Super, each generating driving trajectories alongside CoC reasoning traces that make every decision transparent and auditable. AlpaSim provides closed-loop policy simulation, and AlpaGym enables reinforcement learning on top to learn from edge-case failures across massively parallel GPU simulations. The Physical AI AV Dataset spans 2500+ cities across 25 countries and provides real-world long-tail training data. The CoC Auto-Labeling Pipeline annotates data with meta-actions and reasoning labels automatically.

### Reasoning Labels

Automated reasoning-label generation and open datasets for reasoning-based autonomous driving.

| Tool | Role | Highlights | Resources |
|------|------|------------|-----------|
| **CoC Auto-Labeling Pipeline** | CoC label generation | Three-step keyframe-to-trace pipeline, VLM-based, causally grounded reasoning labels | [NVlabs/alpamayo-coc-autolabeler](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo-coc-autolabeler) |

<details>
<summary><strong>CoC Auto-Labeling Pipeline</strong> — CoC label generation</summary>

NVIDIA CoC Auto-Labeling Pipeline is an open-source auto-labeling pipeline that generates CoC reasoning labels for driving clips automatically. It identifies decision-making keyframes from high-level motion data, runs a VLM pipeline on those keyframes, and organizes cause and effect into decision-grounded, causally linked traces. The output is a strong foundation for training reasoning-based driving models such as Alpamayo 2 Super.

**Three-Step Process:**
1. **Identify the decision-making moment.** Keyframes are defined by critical objects, traffic lights, yield and stop signs, road events, lane lines, and ODD events, detected through sudden changes in egomotion.
2. **Label the explicit driving decision.** Longitudinal and lateral decisions are drawn from a closed action set that eliminates vague behavior descriptions.
3. **Organize cause and effect into a CoC trace.** Causal factors are linked to the resulting decision.

**Highlights:**
- Automated CoC labeling at scale
- Causally grounded traces that reflect the actual reason for each decision
- Closed action set for precise, unambiguous driving decisions
- Used to generate CoC reasoning labels in the NVIDIA Physical AI Open Dataset
